## Personal Minecraft mod to add Staffordshire oatcakes for server

To first learn how to make a mod, I followed this [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pr_iHlVKsI&list=PLKGarocXCE1EO43Dlf5JGh7Yk-kRAXUEJ) for the first few videos to add the basic items and recipes.
Since Minecraft 1.21 and the Fabric API updating, there have been some changes to what some of the videos do. As an example, [registering an item](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:items#:~:text=Adding%20a%20basic%20item%20is,is%20used%20as%20a%20placeholder.) is different to how it's done in the series.
